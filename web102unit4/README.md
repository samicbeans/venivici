# Web Development Project 4 - W

Submitted by: **Discover dogs on this giant Earth!**

This web app: **Allows users to discover new dogs by clicking a button to display a random dog. Users are able to filter attributes so that future dogs will not have any attributes that the user doesn't want**

Time spent: **48** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **Clicking a button creates a new API fetch request and displays at least three attributes from the returned JSON data**
- [x] **Only one item/API call is viewable at a time**
- [x] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [x] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [x] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
- [x] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Multiple types of attributes can be added to the ban list
- [ ] Users can see a stored history of their previously viewed items from their session

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Notes

Learning how to use API calls and reading the documentation for how to use the Dog API was very tricky. It took a while watching videos to understand how the Dog API worked.
